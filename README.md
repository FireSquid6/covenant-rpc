# Covenant

Covenant is a way to have a typesafe rpc.


# Quick Start

Start by defining your covenant. This is all of the functions your frontend can call from your backend

!! Important: Make sure you don't import anything into the interface file that is not safe on the frontend.

Then create the server on the backend


Now create the client on the frontend.
