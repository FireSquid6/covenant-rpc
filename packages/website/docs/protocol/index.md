This is a full description of how covenant clients and servers communicate with each other

# Covenant Protocol V1

Let's first define some terms:
*user* - the end user of an application
*developer* - the person making the application (you, probably)
*server* - the server or edge function that processes
*covenant route* - the http route on the server that supports covenant requests. Must use the POST handler

There are three entities in a covenant connection:
- client: makes and receives messages

TODO: Finish all of this and add a better guide
